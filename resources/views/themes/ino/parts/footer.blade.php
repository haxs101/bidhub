		<p><strong>BidHub Screening Process</strong></p>
		<p><b>Licensing</b></p>
		<p><span>We make sure that our service professional businesses carry any applicable state-level trade licensing for the services for which we match them to consumers.</span></p>

		<p><b>Sex Offender Search</b></p>
		<p><span>We check the websites that consolidate state sex offender information in the state in which the owner/principal of the company is located to confirm that there is not a match based solely on the name of the owner/principal of the company.</span></p>

		<p><b>Legal Search for Civil Judgements</b></p>
		<p><span>We use third-party data sources to check the owner/principal of each business for bankruptcy filings, liens, and significant state-level civil legal judgments, in the state in which the owner/principal of the company is located.</span></p>

		<p><b>State Business Filings</b></p>
		<p><span>For service professionals that are corporations or limited liability companies, we confirm that the business is registered in the state in which it is located, and follows all laws required by the governing state and county it is working in.</span></p>

		<p><b>Criminal Records Search</b></p>
		<p><span>We use third party data sources to conduct a criminal search, in the state in which the owner/principal of the company is located, for any relevant criminal activity associated with the owner/principal of the business. The comprehensiveness of the NCD varies by state. Please be aware that the reporting in the NCD is particularly limited in the following states: AL, CO, DE, GA, ID, KS, KY, LA, ME, MA, MI, MS, MT, NE, NV, NH, NM, SD, UT, VA, VT, and WY.</span></p>

		<p><b>Referrals</b></p>
		<p><span>We ask the subscribing subcontractor for 3 positive references of jobs they have completed before. If the company is a new company, and does not have 3 references yet, we still allow them onto our platform we just track them closely and ask for references as they come so we can make sure they are trusted and qualified.</span></p>

		<p><b>Recommendations for the Homeowners and General Contractors using</b><a href="{{url('/')}}"> <b>{{url('/')}}</b></a></p>
		
		<ul>
		<li><span>Ask to see a copy of the professional’s license to verify that it is current and in compliance with not only the state-level requirements, but also any local level requirements (township, city, county, etc.).</span></li>
		<li><span>Ask whether the professional is insured and bonded.</span></li>
		<li><span>Ask for additional customer references. You can also check</span><span> ratings and reviews</span><span> on Google, Yelp, and many other platforms, to see what other customers have had to say about a pro’s work.</span></li>
		<li><span>Make sure the professional will pull any permits required for your job.</span></li>
		<li><span>Be wary of bids that are substantially higher or lower than the competition. The lowest bid is not always the best!</span></li>
		<li><span>Put it in writing. Get a</span><span> contract</span><span> stating exactly what is included in the scope of work for your project and make sure you review the contract very carefully before ever signing or moving forward with the project until you are %100 happy.</span></li>
		<li><span>Never pay for an entire project upfront.</span></li>
		<li><span>Keep records of everything — including proof of licensing, bonding and insurance, contracts, invoices, proof of payment, progress photos, and all project-related correspondence.</span></li>
