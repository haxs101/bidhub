                <div class="cuscontent">
                <p><strong>Welcome to BidHub!</strong> We are the nation’s only online resource dedicated to building America’s first contractor-to-contractor (C2C&trade;) community. We make it as easy as 1, 2, 3 for general contractors, developers, builders, specialty subcontractors, and real estate agents to come together, work together, and succeed together! </p>

<p>BidHub simplifies how to conduct the business aspects of the building construction industry. BidHub is the newest innovation of incorporating an online bidding platform for all jobs needing bids for builders, contractors, and homeowners alike. We connect you with the best local contractors to get your job completed.</p>

<p>The idea came to us when we realized there was a massive need for something like this in the industry. Through our combined experience in the construction industry we knew that there could be a better way to connect builders and contractors in residential construction. And that is when BidHub was born.</p>
</div>

<h4>Our Mission, Vision, and Values</h4>
<div class="cuscontent" data-aos="fade-left"><p>Having spent the majority of our careers in building construction, we observed many inefficiencies in the way business owners perform daily tasks and spend endless hours searching for the right resources to complete their jobs.</p>

<p><strong>Our mission</strong> is to build and maintain a simple and competitive bidding, resource, and advertising site centered around the residential, commercial, and industrial building construction and home improvement industry.</p>

<p><strong>Our vision</strong> is to create a simple, easy way for general contractors, builders, and developers as well as home improvement companies and other related businesses to connect with specialty subcontractors giving both an easy, quicker, more economical way of doing business.</p>

         <p class="grey-text">Bob is the former owner and founder of B&J Insulators, which was the second largest insulator in the MD/VA area before it was sold to Service Partners, LLC in 1999. He then proceeded to build homes with a new company he founded, Fallon Homes, Inc. He built more than 100 homes in the Southern Maryland area between 1991 and 2009. In 2004, he founded Accurate Insulation, LLC, which he then sold to IBP in 2012 where he is currently managing two locations. Bob was the former President of the Maryland Chapter of Insulation Contractors of America. Bob founded BidHub as he came to the conclusion that this was a service the residential, commercial, and industrial construction industry was lacking and deemed that it would be incredibly valuable with no current competition on the market. He oversees all aspects of the organization to achieve its business goals and ensure complete customer satisfaction.</p>
